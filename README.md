## Real Time Bus Tracker

This page shows an example of how to present a map with a real time bus tracker.  
The marker has been customized to show an image of a bus.  
The map autocenters every 15 seconds at the actual bus location.  
There is a button to start the bus tracking.
Consider the fact that the bus service does not work all day, which means that it is possible that at some times of the day, there will be no bus activity.
